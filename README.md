The "new" folder contains a copy with removed comments and debug printstatements... However, without the comments and printstatements in the current file, it puts a bunch of random garbage characters on the end of the strings, for both the fake arguments and the real arguments. I have not figured out what is causing it, so I just have two copies for now.
